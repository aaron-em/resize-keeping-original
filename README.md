# Resize Keeping Original

A Wordpress plugin to resize uploaded photos while keeping, but
renaming, the original file.

Also bakes EXIF orientation into the image, so the client doesn't have
to bear the responsibility of displaying it right ways up.

I wrote this for my own use, and while I will eventually come back and add configuration via the Wordpress UI, publish in the WP plugin list, &c., at the moment I have several other things higher up my website todo list.

If you want to use the plugin before that happens, you can - you'll just want to edit the option defaults around line 15 to taste, then install it manually by copying it into a directory under `wp-content/plugins/`. It'll then show up in the WP-Admin plugin list, where you can activate it as normal.

If you want to use the plugin but don't feel up to dealing with manual installation and editing the source and all that nonsense, drop me a line or open an issue here! Knowing that someone other than myself is interested in this code will give me incentive to prioritize it more highly than I have thus far.

In the meantime - Share and Enjoy!
